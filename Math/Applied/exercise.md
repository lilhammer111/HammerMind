1. Observing the number of people waiting at a bus stop, we have:

   a. Define the sample space $S$.

   b. Let event $A$ represent "There are at least 5 people waiting."

   c. Let event $B$ represent "The number of people waiting is no more than 2."

   d. Let event $C$ represent "Exactly 3 people are waiting."

   e. Let event $D$ represents "the number of people waiting for the bus is both equal to and greater than 3."

   Answers:

   a. $S = {0, 1, 2,\cdots,n}$, where $n \in \mathbb N$ 

   b. $A = \{r | r \geq 5 \}$

   c. $B = \{0, 1, 2\}$

   d. $C = \{3\}$, an elementary event

   e. $D=\phi$, an impossible event

2. Use a Venn diagram to prove whether the equation $(A \cup B ) - C = A \cup (B - C)$ holds true.
