Quick Start

This projects is for sharing the notes on learning about computers and programming development. 

I rarely take notes while learning something new, because for some reasons it is 'difficult' to do it well. However, when I discovered some note-taking techniques that overcame some of these reasons, I found note-taking to be very interesting and sharing it gave me a sense of fulfillment. 

I'll go into more detail about note-taking in the future, but for now, it's more important for me to learn new techniques quickly.Of course, if any of you would like to offer some corrective interactions with my notes, I'd be happy to do so.
